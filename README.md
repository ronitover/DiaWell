# Diabetes Risk Assessment API

A FastAPI backend for assessing diabetes risk based on patient questionnaire data. This service is designed as part of a microservices architecture to provide structured risk assessment data to other services.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

This project follows a **microservices architecture** where different components handle specific responsibilities:

- **Risk Assessment Service** (This repository): Calculates diabetes risk scores and provides structured risk data
- **Health Recommendations Service**: Generates personalized health tips and recommendations
- **Frontend Application**: User interface for data input and result display

## ‚ú® Features

- **Risk Scoring**: Calculates diabetes risk score (0-100) based on multiple health factors
- **Comprehensive Assessment**: Considers age, BMI, blood pressure, medical history, lifestyle factors, and family history
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Generates health recommendations based on WHO, CDC, and ICMR guidelines
- **AI Enhancement**: Optional Granite AI integration for empathetic, age-appropriate health tips
- **Flutter Ready**: Optimized for Flutter mobile app integration with complete client examples
- **RESTful API**: Clean REST endpoints with automatic documentation
- **Input Validation**: Robust Pydantic models with field validation and examples
- **CORS Enabled**: Ready for cross-platform frontend integration
- **Medical Guidelines**: Evidence-based recommendations from leading health organizations
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Full test suite with coverage reporting
- **CI/CD Ready**: GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- pip

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd backend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables (Optional - for Granite AI enhancement):**
   ```bash
   # Copy the example environment file
   cp env.example .env
   
   # Edit .env file with your IBM WatsonX credentials
   # Get your credentials from: https://cloud.ibm.com/apis/watsonx
   ```
   
   **Note**: The API works without Granite AI configuration. If not configured, it will use the original health tips.

4. **Run the application (Multiple Options):**

   **Option 1: Using the start script (Recommended)**
   ```bash
   python start_server.py
   ```

   **Option 2: Using uvicorn directly**
   ```bash
   python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```

   **Option 3: Using the run script**
   ```bash
   python run.py
   ```

5. **Access the API:**
   - Health check: http://localhost:8000/
   - API docs: http://localhost:8000/docs
   - Alternative docs: http://localhost:8000/redoc

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**1. Import Error: No module named 'app'**
- **Solution**: Make sure you're in the Backend directory when running the server
- **Alternative**: Use `python start_server.py` which handles path issues automatically

**2. Port already in use**
- **Solution**: Change the port in the start script or use a different port
- **Command**: `python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001`

**3. Missing dependencies**
- **Solution**: Install all requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

**4. Permission denied (Linux/macOS)**
- **Solution**: Make scripts executable: `chmod +x start_server.py run.py`

- **BMI ‚â• 30**: +15 points
- **History of high glucose**: +20 points
- **BP ‚â• 140/90**: +25 points
- **Physical activity < 4 hr/week**: +10 points
- **Family history**: second_degree +10, first_degree +20
- **Smoking**: former/moderate +5, current/heavy +15
- **Alcohol**: moderate +5, current/heavy +15

**Risk Levels:**
- 0-30: Low
- 31-60: Medium
- 61-100: High

## üìä Service Integration

This API is designed as a **risk assessment service** that provides structured data to other services:

- **Risk Score**: Numerical score (0-100) indicating diabetes risk
- **Risk Level**: Categorical classification (Low/Medium/High)
- **Risk Flags**: Specific risk factors identified
- **Integration Ready**: Clean data structure for health recommendations services

### Example Integration
See `example_integration.py` for a complete example of how another service would integrate with this API.

## üö® Important Notes

### Risk Scoring Logic
- Risk scoring is based on medical guidelines
- Changes to scoring logic require medical review
- All scoring changes must be documented and tested

### Data Privacy
- No patient data is stored permanently
- All data is processed in memory only
- Implement proper data handling for production

## üìù License
